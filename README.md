# sh
This repository is a collection of my shell scripts. Some are used everyday, while others were written for very specific purposes that I do not carry now. Some of the scripts are not included, as they have their own repositories.

# About the missing scripts
- The files named gpup\* are broken symlinks; if you wish to have a look at them, you can find them [here](https://github.com/XPhyro/gpupmanager).
- You can find the scripts that I use to install an Arch Linux system (to my liking) [here](https://github.com/XPhyro/archinstall).
