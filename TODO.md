# To do
- Integrate -pc option of dmenu into usable scripts.
- Create software alternatives to the `bright*` scripts that work on hardware level. Use `xr --output "$( mondef )" --brightness "$brightness"`. Create a more general version that automatically uses the hardware one if supported on hardware, else use the software one.
- Write an alternative to xargs for stdin. This would allow for nicer flow in some cases (ex. see line 7 of btccdev).
- [notiflog](notiflog) does not work correctly when [lcknotiflog](lcknotiflog) is used, fix.
