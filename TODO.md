# To do
- Integrate -pc option of dmenu into usable scripts.
- Create software alternatives to the `bright*` scripts that work on hardware level. Use `xr --output "$( mondef )" --brightness "$brightness"`. Create a more general version that automatically uses the hardware one if supported on hardware, else use the software one.
- Rewrite [tglapp](tglapp) in C. It proves very useful in a lot of situations, it could do with the performance boost even though it usually takes about 10ms to execute (empty subshell takes 4ms!).
- Optimise [kmcycle](kmycle) and [setxkb](setxkb).
- Write a todo manager which would be a generalised form of the deadline reminder.
- Write a watson wrapper.
- Use `xsel` instead of `xclip`.
- Rewrite `lck`. See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/185451/quick-and-dirty-way-to-ensure-only-one-instance-of-a-shell-script-is-running-at) and [this](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/045).
- Write a variant of `volappch` that toggles mute status.
- Should `-a` be the default in `tglapp`.
- Write a script like `latexstp` for Python to be used with Matplotlib etc.
- Scratchpads in dwm are tagged by monitor. Make `dwmpad` recognise the monitor tags and initialise distinct (by monitor) locks according to the monitor tags.
