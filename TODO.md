# To do
- [ ] Make it so that 'execute' would be able to execute things with arguments.
- [ ] Add brief explanations under shebangs.
- [ ] Integrate -pc option of dmenu into usable scripts.
- [ ] Make getfl, getloc and their derivatives into a hash table with files in some hard-coded directory as initial containers and lines in the files being the contained elements. Then, search through the files (in case there is a hash collision) for the target. This should make searching for the path of a given file/location code a bit faster and more importantly make it roughly O(1).
